# Pull Request Body

The file `pull-request-body.md` will be pulled in at run time to generate the Pull Request body.
This will be used by **Github Actions** to perform the IssueOps and template the repository.

The file can be written in normal `markdown` and will be uploaded to the Pull Request in the same format.
